# User story
- *As a user, I want to have ability to topup my balance with Bitcoin and send payments within Lightning network.*
- *As a product owner, I want to have transparent usage statistics and run-time information on payment channels and environment.*

# Basics

1. LndHub API is standalone software and needs LND client synchronized and running. LndHub API is not a Lightning wallet 
in terms of funds storage, it operates whole amount of available funds on channels. User's balances and transactions 
stored in internal database.

2. LndHub API is accessible for everyone, but only `/create` can be called without authorization token. 

3. To start sending lightning payments user should top-up his Bitcoin balance, by sending Bitcoins to address 
assigned to corresponding user id. User should wait for 3 confirmations after which funds will be available 
for Lightning payments.

4. gRPC RPC framework is used for communication with LND. See https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/lnrpc

5. Outh2 library, MongoDB and Golang backend is used for API implementation. Every request from user is signed and
associated with corresponding user id.

6. Double entry system is used for internal accounting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system
6.1. Internal accounting requirements https://github.com/matveyco/lnd-wallet-api-spec/edit/master/Accounting-requirements.md

7. All amounts are satoshis (int), although millisatoshis are used in LND internally (rounding is up to server implementation).

8. Every account has its separate Lightning, BTC addresses and unique session. If user runs few accounts from one device or wallet, corresponding amount of sessions should be opened.

9. All json keys should be in snake_case

# Explaining oauth2 mechanism
## Oauth2 processes
Oauth2 process consists of such stages as:
- Client (someone, who use api), make request to Authorization service with credentials (POST /auth?type=auth)
- Authorization service checks credentials and searches for appropriate user id and secret (stored on Authorization service and Token service) and sends user id and secret to Token service (for example POST /getinfo/oauth2/token)
- Token service checks user id and secret and sends token data with refresh token to Authorization service which sends it to Client
- Client uses token to access protected resources (GET ?access_token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX)
- When token expires or needs to refresh token for security issues Client sends refresh_token to Token service (POST /auth?type=refresh_token), which sends new token data with refresh_token and disables to access old
